  "gotchas": [
    "The pricing page indicates that access to individual products (Analytics, Guides and Surveys, Experiment, Activation, and Session Replay) is contingent upon purchasing either the new platform suite or individual add-ons. This implies that the listed features under each tier may not be standalone and could be part of a larger bundle.",
    "The 'Plus' plan has a 'Starting at $49/mo' price, but a pricing calculator indicates the cost is based on MTU volume at $0.049 per MTU. For example, 10,000 MTUs would result in an annual price of $582 ($48.50/month). This suggests the $49 is a minimum or a base for a certain MTU range.",
    "While the free tier includes '50K MTUs', the pricing calculator for 'Plus' plan starts at $49/mo and shows $582 annual price for 2.5k MTUs. This implies that exact pricing for Plus, Growth, and Enterprise is not fixed and depends heavily on exact MTU volume.",
    "Specific limits on features like session replays, guides, surveys, and AI feedback records vary and some might be 'Custom' or require add-ons for higher volumes, which are not explicitly priced.",
    "The definition of MTUs (Monthly Tracked Users) is crucial and should be clarified by the user to accurately estimate costs.",
    "The 'Growth' plan offers one free year for early-stage startups under $10M in funding and fewer than 20 employees, but requires application.",
    "The pricing structure for Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans is based on custom MTU or Event volume, meaning upfront quotes are likely necessary for accurate pricing beyond the Starter tier.",
    "While 'Unlimited' is often stated for features like team members, spaces, and saved charts, it's important to consider if there are any practical or hidden limits.",
    "The distinction between different add-on costs for features like 'AI Feedback' is not provided.",
    "The platform suite was updated in February 2024; older pricing or feature sets might not reflect current offerings.",
    "Professional services are listed as 'Available' but are not priced.",
    "Response SLAs are provided for different tiers but are not directly tied to a cost.",
    "The 'Enterprise' tier appears to have very similar feature descriptions to 'Growth' on the comparison table, suggesting potential overlap or advanced capabilities not fully detailed."
