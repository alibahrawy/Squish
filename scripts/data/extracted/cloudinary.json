    "The Free tier for Image and Video APIs is limited by 'monthly credits', which consume based on usage (transformations, bandwidth, etc.). The Free tier for Assets DAM is limited by storage (25GB) and users (3).",
    "The pricing is primarily based on 'credits' (for Image/Video APIs) and storage (for DAM), rather than a direct user count for all tiers. It's a usage-based model.",
    "Overage costs for credits are not explicitly detailed for paid tiers, suggesting they might be custom or handled by contacting support.",
    "Enterprise and Custom tiers require contacting sales for pricing.",
    "The 'Video Bandwidth Boost 2:1' in paid tiers likely means for every 1 unit of bandwidth used by video, you are charged for 2 units.",
    "The 'monthly credits' system for API tiers needs careful estimation to avoid unexpected costs. The page provides a 'Calculate Credits Based on Your Needs' tool.",
    "Storage is a key differentiator for the DAM product's free tier, whereas API tiers focus on 'credits' which encompass more than just storage."
