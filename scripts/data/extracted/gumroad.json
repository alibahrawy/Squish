    "The 'Professional' tier offers access to the Gumroad API, but the fee structure remains the same.",
    "Gumroad's pricing page is a bit misleading as it doesn't explicitly show a 'Free' vs. 'Professional' tier with different features, but rather defaults to 10% for everyone. The 'Professional' aspect seems to be more about API access.",
    "It's crucial to understand that the 10% fee is applied to the gross sale price, not your profit."
