  "gotchas": [
    "The 'Usage that scales' section details pay-as-you-go pricing for executions and events *beyond* the included limits. This is a significant aspect of the overall cost model.",
    "The base price for 'Pro' is '$75 /mo' but usage beyond included limits will incur additional costs.",
    "The 'Hobby' tier is free but has significantly lower included usage limits for executions and events.",
    "Overage pricing for executions is $0.000050 per execution for the first 1m-5m block, then steeply discounts for higher volumes.",
    "Overage pricing for events starts at $0.5 per 1m events.",
    "Concurrency and User overages for the Pro plan are explicitly priced ($25 per 25 concurrent steps, $10/user).",
    "Enterprise plan pricing is custom, requiring direct contact.",
    "HIPAA compliance requires a 'BAAs for healthcare compliance' add-on.",
    "Advanced observability (e.g., Datadog integration) is a $300/mo add-on for Enterprise.",
    "The distinction between 'executions' (runs/steps) and 'events' (received/processed) is crucial for understanding costs."
