    "The Free plan includes 10,500 MAU. Overage costs apply beyond this. For paid plans, 10,500 MAU are still included, but overages are priced at a per-MAU rate ($0.0175 in Pro, $0.0163 in Plus, $0.0151 in Scale).",
    "When Kinde is used for billing, there's a platform fee per customer transaction (0.7% in Free/Pro, 0.6% in Plus, 0.5% in Scale). This fee is separate from the Kinde subscription cost.",
    "Some advanced security features like Bot Protection and Advanced WAF are only available if your custom domain is proxied through Cloudflare.",
    "SCIM is listed as 'Coming soon' for Scale and Plus plans, but is included in Scale.",
    "HIPAA/BAA compliance is not explicitly included in the standard plans but has a 'Price varies' note, suggesting custom solutions or add-ons.",
    "The 'MFA via SMS' feature in the Free plan includes 10 SMS, while Pro and Plus plans offer 'Uncapped' and 'Market rate or BYO provider'. Scale includes 'Uncapped' and 'Market rate'.",
    "Environments are metered across plans, with additional costs for exceeding the included amount. The cost per extra environment decreases with higher tiers.",
    "Kinde Care is a premium support add-on, not included in the base plan prices, with different tiers for general plans and Enterprise.",
    "The 'MAU discount' mentioned for Plus and Scale plans refers to a discount on the MAU overage cost, not the base plan price.",
    "While many features are 'unlimited', some may have underlying technical limits or be governed by fair use policies.",
    "Basic Free plan has only 1 webhook. Unlimited webhooks are available from Pro."
