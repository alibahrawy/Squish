  "gotchas": [
    "The core e-commerce transaction fee is 5% + 50\u00a2. This is separate from any potential additional fees for specific payment methods or international transactions.",
    "While email marketing is free for up to 500 subscribers, pricing scales beyond this threshold and is not explicitly detailed on the page.",
    "Volume-based pricing for e-commerce is available but requires contacting sales.",
    "Some payments may be subject to additional fees, which are not itemized.",
    "The comparison to 'sticky tape solution' implies that these additional costs are what LemonSqueezy aims to consolidate and simplify.",
    "International VAT + sales tax filing is a separate service and appears to have a significant cost ($200 - $5000/m), even though collection is included.",
    "Customer billing support is presented as 'included' when acting as merchant of record, but the cost is approximated as ~$60k/y pp, which is very high and might be a comparison point rather than an actual cost for users."
