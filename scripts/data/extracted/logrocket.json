    "The 'Team' plan has specific session volume tiers (10k, 25k) indicated after the base price, implying further cost increases beyond the initial $69 for 10k sessions/mo.",
    "Professional plan pricing is listed as 'Starting at $295/month' and mentions a 'Startup Plan' for companies with fewer than 20 employees, suggesting potential flexibility or different pricing not fully detailed.",
    "Enterprise pricing is custom and requires contacting sales.",
    "Data retention is limited to 1 month on the Free tier, significantly less than paid plans (which 'start at 1 month' but likely extend).",
    "Conditional Recording, Streaming Data Export, and Feedback are marked as 'Add on', implying they might incur additional costs or be separate features.",
    "Self-hosted deployment is only explicitly mentioned for Enterprise, although it's an 'Add on' for potentially other tiers.",
    "The 'usage' pricing model means costs can fluctuate based on session volume, making budgeting potentially challenging without careful monitoring."
