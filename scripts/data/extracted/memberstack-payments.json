    "The 'Basic' tier lists 'Zero transaction fees' but also '0.9% transaction fee' in the 'Business' tier, which appears to be a typo and should likely be aligned with the Business tier's 0.9%. The 0.9% fee is explicitly stated for the Business tier, making it the actual transaction fee for that plan.",
    "The 'Basic' tier has a limit stated as '10,000+ Members' and also a trigger point of '1,000 Members'. This is confusing. It's implied the free tier is for up to 100 members and $1,200 annual revenue, and the next step is the 'Basic' tier which starts at a lower revenue/member count than '10,000'. The pricing graphic suggests 'Basic' starts at 1,000 members and $1,200 annual revenue. The 'Business' tier appears to be the one with the 0.9% transaction fee and 10,000+ members.",
    "The pricing slider in the image suggests a relationship between 'Member Count' and 'Annual Revenue', with costs changing based on these factors. This suggests a hybrid pricing model or that the listed tiers are examples based on certain thresholds.",
    "The 'Professional' tier has a clear 2% transaction fee but limits users to 5,000. The 'Business' tier offers a lower 0.9% fee for 10,000+ members, making it potentially more cost-effective for larger user bases."
