    "The 'Free forever plan' has a limit of 1,000 members and zero transaction fees, but the paid tiers have transaction fees that decrease as the price increases.",
    "Transaction fees apply to paid plans (except for Business and Established which state 'ZERO transaction fees', implying they might have a higher base cost or custom pricing).",
    "The 'Member Count' listed for each tier appears to be the boundary for when you *might* need that tier, but the monthly cost is fixed at the tier's base price.",
    "The 'Business' and 'Established' tiers both list '10,000+ Members' and 'ZERO transaction fees', suggesting custom pricing or a significant jump in base cost not explicitly detailed for 'over 10,000'.",
    "The pricing page mentions 'Weeks of work. Done in minutes.' and 'Skip the engineering rabbit holes', implying a focus on speed of implementation rather than granular feature sets being the primary differentiator between tiers."
