    "Pricing is primarily based on a credit system. Included credits vary by plan, and exceeding these limits incurs additional costs. Overage credits and add-ons are available.",
    "The Free plan has a 300 credit limit per month. If a single project exceeds its limits, all projects on the account may be paused.",
    "For paid plans, 'auto recharge' for credits is disabled by default. If enabled by a Team Owner, it automatically refills credit balances.",
    "Free and Personal plans do not allow adding additional team member seats. Pro and Enterprise plans do.",
    "Unlimited Reviewer roles are available for all plans, allowing users to access Netlify for feedback without counting as paid members.",
    "Credit costs vary for different usage types: production deploys (15 credits each), compute (5 credits per GB-hour), form submissions (1 credit each), bandwidth (10 credits per GB), and web requests (3 credits per 10k requests).",
    "AI inference costs vary based on the AI model used.",
    "Enterprise plans require custom pricing and contact with sales.",
    "Some features like UI-based rate limiting rules, private connectivity, HIPAA, and Fortified bandwidth are available as add-ons or specific to Enterprise."
