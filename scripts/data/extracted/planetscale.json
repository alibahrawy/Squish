    "Enterprise plan pricing is custom and requires contacting sales.",
    "PlanetScale Managed (BYOC model) involves paying your cloud provider for infrastructure and a percentage fee to PlanetScale. Actual costs can vary significantly based on your cloud provider agreement and usage.",
    "Enterprise tier is required for PCI DSS certified service, single-tenant environments, or keeping data in your own cloud account.",
    "The specific 'cost' for the Base Plan's High Availability and Metal tiers is not listed as a starting price, suggesting it's more dynamic or based on configuration.",
    "Additional development branch hours, SSO, and upgraded support are listed as potential add-ons, which would increase the overall cost."
