    "While the Free tier allows unlimited projects, it has a limited amount of free usage credits per month. Once these credits are exhausted, users will be transitioned to the usage-based billing model.",
    "The pricing page heavily emphasizes savings without providing explicit rates for compute, network, or storage. A dedicated pricing page with detailed rates is not present, requiring users to interact with the savings calculator or the platform directly."
