    "Hobby plan: You will not pay for additional usage beyond limits, but access to Vercel Blob will be blocked until 30 days have passed.",
    "Blobs larger than 512MB are never cached and will incur Fast Origin Transfer charges on every access.",
    "Server Uploads incur Fast Data Transfer charges if your Vercel application is receiving the file.",
    "Multipart uploads count as multiple Advanced Operations (start, each part, completion).",
    "Dashboard interactions count as Advanced Operations.",
    "del() operations are free, but deleting multiple blobs in a batch counts as individual operations towards rate limits.",
    "Edge Requests and Fast Origin Transfer for blobs are billed at standard CDN rates, which are not explicitly detailed in the Blob pricing but are implied to have their own per-GB costs (example shows $0.06/GB for Fast Origin Transfer).",
    "The included resource usage for the Hobby plan is shared across all Vercel services in your project."
