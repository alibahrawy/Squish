    "The 'Free' tier for AuthKit includes the first 1 million active users for free. Beyond that, it's $2,500 per additional 1 million users per month.",
    "Single Sign-On and Directory Sync are priced per connection, with volume-based discounts. The first 15 connections are $125/each, with significant discounts for larger volumes.",
    "Audit Logs has separate pricing for log streaming ($125/month per SIEM connection) and event retention ($99/month per million events stored).",
    "Radar (bot protection) is free for the first 1,000 checks, then $100 per 50k checks.",
    "Custom Domain is an add-on at $99/month.",
    "The distinction between 'Pay as you go' and 'Annual Credits' implies that 'Annual Credits' offers discounts for pre-payment and a more committed plan, but the base costs are not explicitly separated beyond the pre-pay discount.",
    "A 'connection' for SSO/Directory Sync is defined as the relationship between WorkOS and a group of end users (e.g., one enterprise customer). The number of end users within a connection does not affect pricing.",
    "The staging environment is free for testing, but production use will incur costs based on the chosen plan and usage."
